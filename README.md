# blurringshadow-utility

Contains commonly used c++ code that not impl or well impl in other libs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project is meant to be only a template, thus versions of the software used
can be change to better suit the needs of the developer(s). If you wish to use the
template *as-is*, meaning using the versions recommended here, then you will need:

* **CMake v3.15+** - found at [https://cmake.org/](https://cmake.org/)

* **C++ Compiler** - needs to support at least the **C++20** standard, i.e. *MSVC*,
*GCC*, *Clang*

> ***Note:*** *You also need to be able to provide ***CMake*** a supported
[generator](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).*

### Installing

It is fairly easy to install the project, 

After finishing getting a copy of the project, with any of the methods above, create
a new folder in the `include/` folder, with the name of your project.  Edit
`cmake/SourcesAndHeaders.cmake` to add your files.

You will also need to rename the `cmake/ProjectConfig.cmake.in` file to start with
the ***exact name of your project***. Such as `cmake/MyNewProjectConfig.cmake.in`.
You should also make the same changes in the GitHub workflows provided, notably
[`.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml`](.github/workflows/ubuntu.yml), in which you should
replace the CMake option `-DProject_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE=1` to
`-DMyNewProject_ENABLE_CODE_COVERAGE=1`.

Finally, change `"Project"` from `CMakeLists.txt`, from

```cmake
project(
  "Project"
  VERSION 0.1.0
  LANGUAGES CXX
)
```

to the ***exact name of your project***, i.e. using the previous name it will become:

```cmake
project(
  MyNewProject
  VERSION 0.1.0
  LANGUAGES CXX
)
```

To install an already built project, you need to run the `install` target with CMake.
For example:

```bash
cmake --build build --target install --config Release

# a more general syntax for that command is:
cmake --build <build_directory> --target install --config <desired_config>
```

## Building the project

To build the project, all you need to do, ***after correctly
[installing the project](README.md#Installing)***, is run a similar **CMake** routine
to the the one below:

```bash
mkdir build/ && cd build/
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/absolute/path/to/custom/install/directory
cmake --build . --target install
```

> ***Note:*** *The custom ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` can be omitted if you wish to
install in [the default install location](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/GNUInstallDirs.html).*

More options that you can set for the project can be found in the
[`cmake/StandardSettings.cmake` file](cmake/StandardSettings.cmake). For certain
options additional configuration may be needed in their respective `*.cmake` files
(i.e. Conan needs the `CONAN_REQUIRES` and might need the `CONAN_OPTIONS` to be setup
for it work correctly; the two are set in the [`cmake/Conan.cmake` file](cmake/Conan.cmake)).
